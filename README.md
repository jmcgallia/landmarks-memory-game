# Landmarks memory game

This project was created in order to practice the react framework

## Live Version

You can access the live version [here](https://jordan-mcgalliard.github.io/landmarks-memory-game/)

## Features

- A classic memory game
- Choose the 12 landmarks by clicking on them. The goal is to choose all 12 without choosing a duplicate
- A counter to see how many unique landmarks you've clicked on
- Cool background slideshow and menu colors that adjust accordingly

## Tech used

- React
- JavaScript
- Git & Github
- HTML
- CSS

## Things I learned
- Got to practice practice & reinforce skills w/ the technology used
- Test every function you write from the beginning, a lot. Otherwise when something doesn't work it will take forever to even understand where the problem is even coming from.
- Learned more about some frustrating effects of state changes being asynchronous, which can cause bugs if you're not careful how you write your code.

## Known issues
- I resized the images to a resolution that looks okay on a decently sized monitor, but this size is still too big and the transitions can look choppy. I assume with a worse internet connection there would be more problems. Solution: Find a way to load all images before the app begins?
- - Has now been fixed by preloading images
